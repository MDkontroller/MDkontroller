# Hey, I'm Nicolás 👋

Robotics & Computer Vision engineer who likes making machines see and move intelligently (I also like Bender Rodriguez as a good friend).

## What I'm into

🤖 **Autonomous Systems** — perception pipelines, sensor fusion, making robots that don't crash into things  
🎯 **Computer Vision** — from "classical" CV to modern transformers, whatever gets the job done efficiently  
📡 **Sensor Tech** — LiDAR, radar, cameras. Sensing is an art on its own waiting for its Picassos 
🛠️ **Rapid Prototyping** — well, failing constantly here but once a in while nice wins.

## Currently

- Building with **ROS2**, **Isaac Sim**, **STM32**
- Getting deeper into **lightweight inference deployment** and embedded systems.
- Co-organizing [AI Tinkerers Munich](https://munich.aitinkerers.org/) (not very active 😅 hoping to change that soon

## Background

- Published research on deep learning for weather classification using LiDAR
- Former student researcher @ Fraunhofer IVI
- Hackathons everywhere and on many topics: from London to Munich, from Healthcare to Robotics. Always waiting for the chance  :)
  
## Stack

```
Python • PyTorch • OpenCV • ROS2 • C/C++ • Docker • Linux 
```

## Let's talk

If you're working on robotics, perception, or autonomous systems — I'm always down to chat.
